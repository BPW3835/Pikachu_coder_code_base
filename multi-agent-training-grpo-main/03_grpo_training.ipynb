    "# 03. In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization with Flow-GRPO\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third notebook, which dives deep into the training phase of an agentic system. This script implements the **Flow-GRPO (Group Rollout Policy Optimization)** algorithm to fine-tune the agent's core decision-making module, the **Planner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Flow-GRPO?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trains a model to mimic expert trajectories (Input $\\rightarrow$ Optimal Action). However, SFT does not account for the quality of the *outcome* in a real environment. If the expert makes a mistake early on, the model learns the mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) addresses this by rewarding the agent based on the *final success* of its entire trajectory. Flow-GRPO is a custom RL algorithm derived from **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, tailored for multi-step, agentic tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **On-Policy Learning:** The agent learns directly from its own generated experience (trajectories).\n",
    "2.  **Group Rollouts (The GRPO part):** For a single input query, the agent generates $N$ diverse trajectories ($N$ = `rollout_n`). This group of outcomes allows us to compute a **relative advantage** (or counterfactual reward) for each trajectory. Instead of a trajectory simply being \"good\" or \"bad,\" it is judged relative to the other outcomes in its group.\n",
    "3.  **Stability (The PPO part):** It uses the PPO objective, which constrains the policy update size (via the clipping mechanism, $\\epsilon$), preventing the new policy from deviating too radically from the old policy, ensuring stable training.\n",
    "4.  **Reward from External Judge (RLHF):** The reward signal comes from a powerful, fixed \"Judge LLM\" (like GPT-4o) which acts as an impartial evaluator, providing a nuanced, human-aligned reward for the final answer quality.\n",
